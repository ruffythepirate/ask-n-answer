# Introduction

A tool that looks in a folder and indexes the questions.

It is possible to: 

* Write new questions and responses.
* Search the question and responses with keywords.
* Resave files on save.
* Read a directory and list all the files in there as options.

1) I add + and - for Add and delete topic [FIXED]
2) Add a border to the panels
3) I check how to package the application as a runnable for mac.
4) I add hotkeys to focus Search, Editor and panel.
5) I display notifications (As toast, maybe, or as a message at the bottom)
6) Command N creates a new topic (just a buffer in editor panel, a new file in navigation.
 
There is a backend with methods : 

* search
* get / post / put / delete

# Plan

* Create a user interface.
* Do a search window
* Test that search displays the results.
* Test that navigating in the list to the left changes document.
* Verify
